## üìä Quick Reference

### System Requirements
- **Runtime**: Bun 1.0+
- **Memory**: 512MB minimum, 2GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB minimum (depends on dataset size)
- **Network**: Stable internet for Airtable API access

### Key Commands
```bash
# Installation
bun install

# Development
bun --hot index.ts

# Testing
bun test

# Production
bun index.ts
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_TOKEN=pat_your_token
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app_your_base_id
BEARER_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Optional
PORT=3000
REFRESH_INTERVAL=86400
ENABLE_ATTACHMENT_DOWNLOAD=true
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Service won't start | Check environment variables and file permissions |
| High memory usage | Review dataset size and refresh interval |
| Slow performance | Check database indexes and attachment settings |
| API errors | Verify Airtable token permissions and base access |

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Review application logs for error details
2. **Verify config**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
3. **Test connectivity**: Verify network access to Airtable API
4. **Review docs**: Check relevant documentation sections
5. **File issue**: Report bugs on the project repository
