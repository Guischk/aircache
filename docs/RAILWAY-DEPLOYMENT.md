# 🚀 Railway SQLite Deployment Guide

## ✅ Prerequisites Verified

All necessary elements have been put in place:

- ✅ Package.json scripts updated for SQLite
- ✅ railway.toml configured for SQLite with volumes
- ✅ .gitignore protects SQLite data and storage
- ✅ Workers and API adapted for SQLite
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Deployment test script

## 🧪 Pre-deployment Testing

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Start the SQLite application
bun run start:sqlite

# In another terminal, test
bun test-sqlite-deployment.ts
```

### 2. Manual Verification
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# API with auth
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/tables

# Stats
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/stats
```

## 🚀 Railway Deployment

### Option A: Existing Project Migration (Recommended)

#### 1. Backup and Preparation
```bash
# Backup current environment
cp .env .env.redis.backup

# Verify configuration
cat railway.toml
cat .env.example
```

#### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migration to SQLite - Simplified architecture and reduced costs

- Replace Redis with SQLite (bun:sqlite)
- Integrated attachment storage
- Daily refresh instead of 1h30
- Expected savings: $15 → $2-3/month (80% savings)
- 100% compatible API with Redis version"

git push origin main
```

#### 3. Railway Dashboard Configuration

**Environment variables to configure:**
```env
AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your-token
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your-base-id
BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token
SQLITE_V1_PATH=/app/data/aircache-v1.sqlite
SQLITE_V2_PATH=/app/data/aircache-v2.sqlite
SQLITE_METADATA_PATH=/app/data/metadata.sqlite
STORAGE_PATH=/app/storage/attachments
REFRESH_INTERVAL=86400
CACHE_TTL=86400
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### 4. Remove Redis Service
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Delete the Redis service
4. **Immediate savings: -$10-12/month**

### Option B: New Railway Project

```bash
# Initialize a new project
railway login
railway init aircache-sqlite
railway up

# Configure environment variables
railway variables set AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_TOKEN=your-token
railway variables set AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your-base-id
railway variables set BEARER_TOKEN=your-bearer-token
```

## 📊 Post-deployment Monitoring

### 1. Immediate Checks
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# Stats API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEARER_TOKEN" \
     https://your-app.railway.app/api/stats
```

### 2. Railway Logs
- Monitor startup logs
- Verify creation of `/app/data` and `/app/storage` folders
- Confirm SQLite connection
- Observe the first refresh

### 3. Metrics to Monitor
- **Response time**: Should be ≤ Redis version
- **SQLite DB size**: Normal growth according to your data
- **RAM usage**: Should be more stable
- **CPU usage**: Spikes during daily refreshes

## 💰 Cost Savings Achieved

| Component | Before | After | Savings |
|-----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Application | ~$3/month | ~$2-3/month | $0 |
| Redis Service | ~$10-12/month | **$0** | **-$12/month** |
| Storage | External | Included | Variable |
| **TOTAL** | **~$15/month** | **~$2-3/month** | **~80%** |

## 🔧 New Features

### Automatic Attachments
```bash
# Airtable files are now:
# - Automatically detected
# - Downloaded during refresh
# - Stored in /app/storage/attachments
# - Served via /api/attachments/:id
```

### Optimized Refresh
```bash
# New cycle:
# - Daily refresh (instead of 1h30)
# - 90% fewer Airtable API calls
# - Manual refresh via POST /api/refresh
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Performance
- **Latency**: Local SQLite should be faster than network Redis
- **Concurrent writes**: SQLite serializes writes (normal behavior)
- **DB size**: Monitor growth, optimized for several GB

### Data
- **Automatic migration**: First sync recreates the entire cache
- **Persistence**: No more cache loss on restart
- **Backup**: Single SQLite file to backup

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# If problems occur, check:
ls -la /app/data/        # SQLite files created?
ls -la /app/storage/     # Attachments folder created?
cat /app/data/aircache-v1.sqlite # DB v1 not empty?
cat /app/data/aircache-v2.sqlite # DB v2 not empty?

# Useful logs:
grep "SQLite" /var/log/app.log
grep "Worker" /var/log/app.log
```

## 🔙 Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

### 1. Code Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### 2. Reconfigure Redis
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
# 1. Add Redis service
# 2. Reconfigure REDIS_URL
# 3. Remove SQLite variables
```

### 3. Restore Environment
```bash
cp .env.redis.backup .env
```
